# YouTube Schema Design Project

## Overview

This repository contains a detailed case study and schema design for YouTube, one of the world's leading video-sharing platforms. The project explores YouTube's data architecture, focusing on key entities, attributes, and relationships that underpin the platform's functionality.

## Project Description

In this project, we dissected YouTube's core features and functionalities to design a comprehensive schema that encapsulates the essence of its operations. The goal was to understand how YouTube organizes and utilizes its data to support its diverse range of features and user interactions.

- **Subscription**: Manages subscriptions with `SubscriptionID`, `SubscriberUserID`, `ChannelUserID`, and `Subscription_Date`.
- **Tag**: Stores tags with `TagID` and `Tag_Text`.
- **VideoTag**: Links videos with tags through `VideoTagID`, `VideoID`, and `TagID`.
- **Category**: Contains video categories with `CategoryID` and `Category_Name`.
